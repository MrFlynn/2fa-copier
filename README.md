# 2FA-Copier

**Note: Apple broke the functionality of this script in High Sierra/Mojave. It
should still work in Sierra (10.12) and below. I'm exploring replacement options
at the moment.**

This is a simple application that extracts 2FA SMS codes from the iMessage app
and prompts the user to copy it to their clipboard. This is a pretty simple
application, but it saves the user a few steps when copying a new
authentication code.

## Installation:
Installation is fairly straightforward. The recommended method is using Homebrew.
Run the following commands to install it.
```sh
$ brew tap MrFlynn/2fa-copier
$ brew install Auth-Code-Copier
```
